        <p>I am a licensed clinical social worker and psychotherapist in private practice in Randolph, N.J. I have 30+ years of experience helping people deal with and grow beyond troubling personal issues. I have substantial post graduate training which fosters in-depth work, but I also see people for short term therapy.</p>

        <p>I work with individual adults and couples who come in for many reasons including depression, anxiety, self esteem, relationship issues such as affairs, communication problems, intimacy issues, problems with children of all ages, problems with parents and extended families. I also work with chronically ill and terminally ill people and family members.</p>

        <p>You may be apprehensive about beginning therapy, but you will most likely find our first meeting a positive experience in which you feel understood and listened to. You will leave with an overview of our initial objectives and how we will approach the work we will do together.</p>
